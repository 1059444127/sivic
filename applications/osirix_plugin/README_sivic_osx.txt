This is a beta version of the SIVIC MRS software suite.  
Please read the tutorial and download the sample data.  

This OsX distribution contains the SIVIC plugin for OsiriX as well as a standalone version of the SIVIC GUI which is installed in /Applications.

Note that OsiriX 3.7.1 has a bug that prevents upload of DICOM MRS object.  This has been fixed in the OsiriX src code and should be fixed in the next OsiriX release.
