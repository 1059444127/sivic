NOTE: The atlas provided with this distribution comes from the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. The prescription files in this directory were all developed on the FSL 4.1 MNI152 T1 atlas ( can be found at fsl/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm.nii.gz). The license of this atlas is not compatible with the SIVIC project however any MNI-space atlas should work with this software but the same atlas should be used for comparable results.
